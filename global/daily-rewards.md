# ðŸ’¸ Daily Rewards

The Daily Rewards System allows players to claim a random number of rubies each day by using the `/daily` command. The number of rubies awarded ranges from 1 to 10, with the chances of receiving higher amounts being significantly lower. Players can use this command on themselves or specify another player to receive the rewards.

### Ruby Chances

The probability of receiving each amount of rubies is as follows:

* **1 Ruby**: 50%
* **2 Rubies**: 25%
* **3 Rubies**: 12.5%
* **4 Rubies**: 6.25%
* **5 Rubies**: 3.13%
* **6 Rubies**: 1.56%
* **7 Rubies**: 0.78%
* **8 Rubies**: 0.39%
* **9 Rubies**: 0.20%
* **10 Rubies**: 0.10%

### Command Usage

#### `/daily`

When a player uses the `/daily` command, they will receive a random amount of rubies based on the chances outlined above. If no player is specified, the command will reward the player who issued the command.

### Cooldown

There is a 24-hour cooldown for claiming daily rewards. Once a player has claimed their reward, they must wait 24 hours before they can claim again.

### Claiming Rewards

Players must claim their daily rewards through an in-game menu. The command initiates the reward process, but players need to interact with the menu to finalize the claim and receive their rubies.
