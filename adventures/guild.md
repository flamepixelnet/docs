# ⛏️ Guild

The Guild System in Minecraft allows players to join together, form alliances, and compete collectively in battles. With features like custom guild tags, unique names, a friends-invite system, and a guild menu for easy management, players can enjoy a more interactive and social gaming experience. Guilds enhance teamwork, provide shared goals, and offer new gameplay dimensions on multiplayer servers.

### How to Create a Guild

To create a guild, follow these simple steps:

1. **Go to the Adventurer’s Guild**: First, make your way to the Adventurer’s Guild. This is usually a special location or NPC (Non-Player Character) in the game that will help you with guild creation.
2. **Choose a Guild Tag**: Select a unique tag for your guild, typically 3-4 characters long. This tag will represent your guild in chat and other guild-related displays.
3. **Choose a Guild Name**: Pick a name for your guild, between 3 and 14 characters. Make it memorable and reflective of your guild's identity!
4. **Pay the Cost**: Guild creation requires a fee of 1,000 coins. Ensure you have enough money in your account before proceeding.
5. **Done!** Once you've selected your tag, name, and paid the fee, your guild is officially created! You can now invite friends, organize guild events, and start building your guild’s reputation.

### **Features**

1. **Customizable Guild Tag**: When creating a guild, players can select a custom tag (3-4 characters) to represent their guild in the chat or above player names. Tags help guild members stand out and showcase their affiliation.
2. **Unique Guild Names**: Guild names can be chosen by the leader, typically with character limits between 3 and 14 characters. These names help identify guilds and add personality to each group.
3. **Invite Friends**: Guild leaders or members with permission can invite friends to join their guild. This system fosters a social community and encourages players to team up, strategize, and compete as a group.
4. **Guild Battles**: Members can battle together as a guild in PvP or PvE events. This team-based approach gives guilds a chance to compete against others or face challenging mobs as a united force, testing coordination and skills.
5. **Guild Menu**: A dedicated guild menu makes managing the guild simple and accessible. Through this menu, members can view guild details, see member lists, manage ranks and permissions, and track guild achievements or progress.
6. **Guild Progression and Rewards**: Many guild systems include levels, achievements, or rewards that guilds can unlock as they progress. Completing tasks together can grant guild-wide buffs, special items, or increased privileges, encouraging players to stay active and contribute.

### **How It Works**

* **Creating a Guild**: A player (often called the guild leader) can start a guild by selecting a name and tag that meet the character requirements. This guild becomes a new team that other players can join by invitation.
* **Managing Guild Members**: Using the guild menu, leaders can invite new members, manage ranks, and set permissions. Different roles within the guild (e.g., member, officer, leader) allow specific players to invite others, lead battles, or manage resources.
* **Participating in Guild Battles**: Guild members can join forces in organized battles, either against other guilds (PvP) or in special PvE events where they face mobs. In these events, guild tags and names are displayed, promoting the guild’s unity and identity.
* **Guild Menu Navigation**: The guild menu is accessible to all members, providing options to view member status, see guild statistics, and access guild-specific functions. Leaders use this menu to manage guild settings, assign roles, and monitor guild progression.



### **Benefits**

* **Enhanced Social Interaction**: The invite system and guild-exclusive chat encourage players to form connections and friendships within the server.
* **Organized Team Play**: With guild battles and PvE events, players experience organized team-based gameplay, adding a strategic layer to Minecraft.
* **Player Identity and Customization**: Guild tags and unique names give players a sense of identity and belonging. Guilds often become a point of pride, and players are motivated to represent their guild in battles and events.
