# ðŸŽ© Claim System

The Flamepixel Claim System is a powerful tool that allows players to protect and manage their land on a multiplayer server. By creating claims, players can secure their builds, resources, and structures, preventing other players from making changes within their claimed area. Claims operate on a chunk-by-chunk basis, making it easy to expand and control territory in organized sections. This system is ideal for survival servers where protection and cooperation are essential.

***

**Getting Started with Claims**

To start claiming land, players need to use the `/claim` command, which reserves the chunk theyâ€™re currently standing in. Once claimed, only the owner and trusted members have the ability to build, interact with blocks, or access containers within the area. Claims can also be customized with various settings and permissions.

**Creating a Claim**

* **/claim create** - This command creates a new claim in the current chunk. The land is now protected, and no other players can interfere with it unless given permission.

**Note**: Some servers may require in-game currency or resources to claim land. Check with server rules or staff to understand any limitations.

#### Managing Your Claim

Once a claim is created, players have access to several commands to customize, expand, and control it. Hereâ€™s a list of useful commands for managing your claims:

1. **/claim description** - Sets a description for your claim. Useful for adding personal notes or details about the claim.
2. **/claim bounds** - Visually highlights the boundaries of the claim so you can see exactly where it starts and ends. Helps with planning expansions and organizing space.
3. **/claim flags** - Allows setting specific flags that affect behavior within the claim. Flags can control aspects like PvP, mob spawning, and fire spread, making claims customizable to your preferences.
4. **/claim help** - Displays a list of all available commands and their functions. Handy for new players or quick reminders.
5. **/claim list** - Lists all claims that you currently own. This is especially useful for players with multiple claims, allowing easy navigation between them.
6. **/claim listall** - Shows a list of claims owned by all players on the server. Server owners and staff often use this command to monitor claim distribution.
7. **/claim members** - Opens the member management menu where you can add or remove players from your claim. Members can help you build, farm, and access certain resources within your claim.
8. **/claim merge** - Merges two or more adjacent claims into a single, larger claim, allowing more flexible space management.
9. **/claim rename** - Renames the claim. This feature is useful for organizing multiple claims or marking areas with specific purposes.
10. **/claim separate** - Splits previously merged claims back into their original, smaller claims. Useful for dividing territory or managing different areas separately.
11. **/claim setspawn** - Sets a spawn point within the claim, so you or other members can quickly teleport to the area. This is ideal for returning to specific points within larger builds.
12. **/claim settings** - Opens a settings menu to adjust claim permissions and customize the claimâ€™s behavior, such as access permissions for containers, doors, and interactions.
13. **/claim transfer** - Transfers ownership of the claim to another player. Perfect for trading land or passing control to a friend.
14. **/claim delete** - Deletes the claim, making the area available for other players or for new claims.

#### Claim Permissions and Flags

Claims can be customized with different permissions and flags to control how players interact within the area.

These settings give you complete control over your claimed area, ensuring a secure and customizable experience.

***

#### Claim Economy and Limits

Some servers use an economy system where each claim requires a certain amount of currency or resources. Servers might also set limits on the number or size of claims a player can own to prevent monopolization of land. Check your serverâ€™s guidelines to understand any specific requirements or limitations.

#### Benefits of the Claim System

* **Protection**: Prevents griefing and unauthorized building or looting within your land.
* **Customization**: Allows you to set specific rules for each claim, tailored to your play style.
* **Team Play**: Invite friends to build, explore, and manage the claim together, creating a community within your protected area.
* **Organization**: By creating chunks, players can easily expand or manage land without losing track of boundaries.

#### Common Uses of the Claim System

* **Base Building**: Protect your house, farm, or base from unwanted visitors.
* **Public Structures**: Build community areas, shops, or trade posts with limited access settings.
* **Event Areas**: Set up specific zones for PvP battles or mob arenas with adjusted flags.
