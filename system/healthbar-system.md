# ðŸ’š Healthbar System

The Bossbar Health Bar System in Minecraft provides a dynamic health display for mobs, visible above the mob's head whenever a player looks at it. This health bar system allows players to see real-time updates on mob health, including the damage they deal, making combat interactions more immersive and informative. This system is limited to mobs, ensuring it doesnâ€™t clutter the interface when players are viewing each other.

### **Features**

1. **Health Display Above Mobs**: The health bar appears above mobs when a player is looking at them, providing a clear view of the mobâ€™s current health.
2. **Damage Tracking**: The system shows the exact amount of damage inflicted each time a player attacks a mob. This allows players to see their damage output and adjust their strategy accordingly.
3. **Mob-Specific Display**: The health bar system is designed specifically for mobs. Players do not have health bars, keeping the visual focus on non-player entities and ensuring minimal interface clutter in PvP scenarios.
4. **Real-Time Health Update**: As the mob takes damage, the health bar decreases in real time, showing a visual representation of the remaining health. This is particularly useful for players to gauge how close a mob is to being defeated.

### **Use Cases**

* **Enhanced PvE Combat**: By showing players exactly how much health a mob has left, this system enhances combat depth and strategy. Players can better manage their attacks and resources, especially in boss fights or against mobs with high health.
* **Damage Output Feedback**: For players who want to optimize their gear or skills, seeing real-time damage output can be valuable in assessing weapon effectiveness or evaluating enchantment setups.

### **Conclusion**

The Custom Health Bar System is a valuable addition to Minecraft, providing players with real-time information on mob health and damage dealt. This feature enhances the combat experience, especially in PvE-focused settings, by delivering precise feedback and enabling strategic gameplay adjustments. With careful implementation, it can add immersion and utility to various Minecraft gameplay scenarios.
